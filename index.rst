About Us
================

AmpLabs helps teams build better batteries. 

Building off of the great Open Source work related to the Battery Data Genome, we are developing the components to realize an Open Source Battery Data Platform to help the entire battery value chain cut down on redundant work. 

We want to close the gaps on solved problems so that teams can focus on building better batteries.  


Problem Statement
----------------

2 Fundamental Problems facing the Battery Industry as Identified in the `Principles of the Battery Data Genome <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07278>`__


**Heterogeneity**

> Establishing the data and metadata conventions that will make heterogeneous data useful and enable interoperability, and rapid, large-scale capture of data from many sources and contributors

**Scale**

> Modern data science methods require large amounts of data and the battery community lacks the requisite scalable, standardized data hubs required for immediate use of these approaches. Lack of uniform data practices is a central barrier to the scale problem.


Project Obectives
----------------

Build useful software that **anyone** who works with batteries can use

Build a sturdy **foundation** upon which other developers can build on top

Build a library of **reusable components** that develop software & data standards


Key Areas of Focus
----------------

- Library of Cycler Converters

- Schema Mapping

- API Ecosystem

- Dashboard with Standard Plots


Milestones
----------------

Standard data tools and practices built from the data hub standards will create a new data app marketplace.


AmpLabs Platform
=================

Inspired by `Battery Lifecycle Framework <https://github.com/battery-lcf>`__ with integrations into other community projects such as `BEEP <https://github.com/TRI-AMDD/beep>`__  and `Galvanalyser <https://github.com/Battery-Intelligence-Lab/galvanalyser>`_. AmpLabs puts these components together in a scalable and performant way to bring the concepts introduced by the `Battery Data Genome <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07278>`__ in a user friendly manner. 

Try out the live hosted version of AmpLabs by visiting https://amplabs.ai

If you are interested in deploying AmpLabs in your own lab, you can do so with the `Ampcloud Service <https://github.com/amplabs-ai/ampcloud-service>`__
