# Instructions of Using the Battery Data Plotting Examples in this Python Folder

##Running in Local Jupyter Notebook

- Step 1: Create a new folder within your local environment named "test files". This folder name has been included in the ".gitignore" file, and any document edits within the "test files" folder will not affect the GitHub repository's workflow.
- Step 2: Copies the one of the Python example ".ipynb" files from the example folders into the "test files" folder.
- Step 3: Now the Python example ".ipynb" file should be ready to use. Play around with the Python examples within the "test files" folder only.
- Step 4: Follow the instructions to add "user_token" and "cell_id" below.


##Running in Google Colab

- Step 1: Open one of the Python example ".ipynb" file
- Step 2: Click the "Open in Colab" button on top of the ".ipynb" file
- Step 3: The Colab page will be shown. Follow instructions on setting up Colab at the Colab page. If prompted to authorize Colab to use Github, go ahead to authorize. Now the Python example ".ipynb" file should be ready to use.
- Step 4: Follow the instructions to add "user_token" and "cell_id" below.


##Add "user_token" and "cell_id" 

- Step 1: Go to the "[amplabs.ai](https://amplabs.ai)" website, and click "try Amplabs Cloud".
- Step 2: Sign up and log into Amplabs Cloud. There, on the top right menu, click "get API token".
- Step 3: Copied the token into the "ipynb" file in Jupyter notebook or Google Colab to replace the "<your-token>" in the "user_token = '<your-token>' " line. 
- Step 4: In the Amplabs Cloud page that has been logged in, choose a sample at the left side of the webpage and click "Load" at the top left.
- Step 5: Copy the "Cell Id" and paste it into the "ipynb" file in Jupyter notebook or Google Colab to replace the "your-cell-id" in the "cell_id = 'your-cell-id'" line.
